# FPS-students2019

This is test repo for my students. I teach GODOT engine at University in Bialystok, Poland.

FPS-students2019 is the very first 3D project in GODOT, so please don't expect too much at the moment. I'll update the repo every week, so if you are interested - please visit and update it too.

Please don't be surprised that all variables' names are in polish - that is done by intention. In general, I don't like to mess English/Polish words togenter, but here - for the educational purpose - I decided to call my variables in Polish (as well as some functions). By doing that I distinguish stuff build in GODOT engine from my own piece of code.
